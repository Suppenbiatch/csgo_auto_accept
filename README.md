# csgo_auto_accept
An Auto-Accept-Script for Counter-Strike Global Offensive

To run one needs to clone the repo and have Python 3.X installed.
Once downloaded run pip install -r requirements.txt in a command-line in the repo folder

!! THIS SCRIPT NEEDS A DISCORD BOT AS A "BACKEND" !!

After that you'll need to make changes to the config_clean.ini.
- Change its name to config.ini
	- `Account 1` section
		- Add your Steam ID 64 in "Steam ID"
		- AutoBuy can be edited
			- AutoBuy will executed the appropriate script if the player has not tabbed until the BuyTime is almost over
			- `AutoBuy` is the same as `AutoBuy 0` -> will always run
			- `AutoBuy 1700T` will only execute if > 1700$ and on T-Side
			- `AutoBuy 1700CT` will only execute if > 1700$ and on CT-Side
			- `AutoBuy 2000` will only execute if > 2000$
			- AutoBuy will go through in reverse -> highest match will be executed and nothing after that
	- `csgostats.gg` section

	- `Notifier` section
		- `Discord User ID`: A Discord User ID -> If set, enables to send afk messages via discord

		- `WebHook Port`: Port to be used for the WebHook Server
	- `Script Settings`
		- `TelNet IP`: "127.0.0.1" -> no idea why this is a config param

		- `Anti-AFK Delay`: Seconds after being tabbed out until the anti-afk script starts
		- `AFK Reset Delay`: Seconds after tabbed in until the anti-afk script timer resets
- Add `-netconport [port]` to the launch options of csgo, `port` needs to be same as set in `TelNet Port`
- Add multiple accounts by creating a new section called `Account 2` until `Account X` with the same `keys` as `Account 1`
